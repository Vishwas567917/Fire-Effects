## Project Overview

The project uses JavaScript to manipulate a canvas element, creating a visually appealing fire effect. The key components of this project are:

- **Canvas Element:** The canvas provides the drawing surface for the fire effect.
- **Lines and Particles:** A collection of lines that move and change over time to simulate fire.
- **Dynamic Properties:** The effect uses various properties to control the color, light, and behavior of the lines to create a dynamic fire-like animation.

## Code Structure

- **HTML:** Defines the canvas element and includes the JavaScript script.
- **CSS:** Styles the canvas element and ensures proper layout.
- **JavaScript:** Contains the logic for generating the fire effect, including the lines' movement and color changes.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local environment.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The fire effect will start automatically, with lines and particles creating a dynamic visual.
4. Resize the browser window to see the effect adjust to the new dimensions.
